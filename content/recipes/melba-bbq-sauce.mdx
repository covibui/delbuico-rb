  1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add all of the remaining ingredients except the water and coffee. Slowly stir in the water and coffee until the mixture has the consistency of ketchup. Make sure all the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat to medium and simmer the sauce for 20 to 30 minutes. Stir in additional water and coffee if the sauce becomes too thick.


  2. Use at once.
