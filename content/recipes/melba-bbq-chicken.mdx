      Rinse chicken with cold water. After rinsing with cold water, pat dry with paper towels – this will ensure crispy skin.


      In a medium bowl, mix all the rub ingredients and then, in a large bowl, rub the chicken with the rub and allow to marinate for four hours in a refrigerator.


      Pull the chicken out of the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature (about 30 minutes).Preheat your grill or grill pan and then place the chicken on it. Grill chicken, turning to ensure it is cooked on both sides and then brush with 4 ounces of BBQ sauce.


      The internal temperature of the chicken should be 165 degrees. Serve with great sides, like collard greens or mac and cheese, and of course, with your favorite BBQ sauce -- for those wanting even more flavor!
