      1. Heat the oil in a large pot to 350 degrees on a deep-fry or candy thermometer.


      2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar.


      3. Mix in the onion and bell pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together buttermilk and eggs. Slowly pour the buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Gently drop the hush puppy batter into the oil 1 tablespoon at a time.


      4. Dip the spoon in a glass of cold water after each hush puppy. They're done when they turn golden brown on all sides (you may need to flip them in the oil) and rise tithe top, about 6 minutes. Drain them on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.
