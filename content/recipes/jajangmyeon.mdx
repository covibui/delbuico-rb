  *Jajangmyeon is a popular Korean-Chinese dish. Learn how to make these delicious black bean noodles at home with this easy to follow recipe!*



  Jajangmyeon (자장면), also called jjajangmyeon (짜장면), is a noodle dish in a black bean sauce. Along with [jjamppong](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/jjam-bbong-korean-chinese-spicy-noodle/) (짬뽕, spicy seafood noodle soup) and [tangsuyuk](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/tangsuyuk-sweet-and-sour-beef-or-pork/) (탕수육, sweet and sour pork or beef), it’s a popular Korean-Chinese dish. Called collectively as Junghwa Yori (중화요리), [Korean-Chinese cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Chinese_cuisine) was developed by early Chinese immigrants in Korea. It’s a huge part of Korean food culture.





  ## **Types of Korean black bean noodles**


  **Jjajangmeyon (짜장면):** When there’s no other word in front of it, it simply refers to regular jajangmyeon, also known as yetnal jajangmyeon — yetnal meaning from the past or old-fashioned. For this type, water or stock is added to the sauce as well as some starch slurry to thicken it. The resulting sauce is liquidy.


  **Ganjjajangmyeon (간짜장면):** The dish is made without the addition of any water or stock or thickening for the sauce. As a result, the sauce is dry with more solid ingredients per serving.


  **Samseon jjajangmyeon (삼선짜장면):** Samseon means fresh delicacies from 3 sources — land, sea and sky, but in Korean-Chinese cuisine, it commonly refers to a dish with various seafoods. There’s usually samseon ganjjajangmyeon (삼선간짜장면) on the menu as well.


  **Euni jjajangmyeon (유니짜장면):** Jajangmyeon made with ground meat.


  **Jaengban jjajang (쟁반짜장면):** The noodles are stir-fried with the sauce and served in a large platter to be shared.
ingredients:
  - item: 3 to 4 servings fresh jajangmyeon/ udon noodles (about 6 ounces per
      serving)
  - item:
      5 tablespoons Chunjang (춘장), Korean black bean paste some may be labeled
      as jjajang (짜장)
  - item: 2 tablespoons cooking oil
  - item: 1 tablespoon sugar
  - item: 1 tablespoon oyster sauce - optional
  - item: 1 cup chicken stock or water
    substitute: You can add 1/2 cup more for thinner, more liquidy/watery sauce.
  - item: 1 tablespoon potato or corn starch
    substitute: dissolved in 1/4 cup of chicken stock or water
  - item:
      8 to 10 ounces pork (preferably with some visible fat, pork shoulder cut,
      Boston butt, etc.)
  - item: 1 teaspoon grated ginger
  - item: 1 tablespoon rice wine (or mirin)
  - item: ⅛ teaspoon each salt and pepper
  - item: 2 tablespoons cooking oil
  - item: 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - item: 1 extra large onion (or 2 medium, 12 to 14 ounces)
  - item: 8 ounces green cabbage
  - item: 8 ounces zucchini
    substitute: 1 small cucumber for garnish - optional
directions:
  - step: >-
      Have a pot of water ready to cook the noodles. Turn the heat on when you
      start cooking the meat. This way you will have the boiling water ready,
      for cooking the noodles, by the time the sauce is done.


      Prepare the pork and vegetables by cutting them into 1/2 - 3/4 inch cubes. Marinate the pork with a tablespoon of rice wine (or mirin), ginger, salt and pepper while preparing the vegetables.
  - step: >-
      Add the black bean paste to a small saucepan with the oil, sugar, and the
      optional oyster sauce. Fry it over medium heat for 2 - 3 minutes, stirring
      constantly.



      Heat a large pan with 2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium high heat. Add the pork and stir fry until no longer pink, adding a tablespoon of soy sauce half way through. 

      Add the onion and cook until soft, stirring occasionally.


      Add the cabbage and zucchini and continue to stir fry until vegetables are softened.


      Stir in the black bean paste and mix everything together until all the meat and vegetables are coated well with the paste.
  - step: >-

      Mix everything together until all the meat and vegetables are coated well with the paste. If you like ganjjajang, you can stop here and skip the next two steps.



      Pour in the stock (or water) and bring it to a boil. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes



      Stir in the starch slurry and cook briefly until the sauce is thickened. Add more sugar to taste.
  - step: >-

      Add the noodles in the boiling water. Cook according to the package instructions and drain. Do not overcook. The noodles should have a firm bite to them (al dente). Place a serving size of noodles in each bowl. Spoon the sauce over the noodles and garnish with the optional cucumber matchsticks. Alternatively, you can serve over cooked rice

  1.If you're adding some potatoes, dice them smaller than the other vegetables, and add to the pan when the onions are added. Or you can briefly cook diced potatoes in the microwave because it takes longer to cook potatoes than the other vegetables. 


  2. Ganjajang is a drier sauce made without the addition of any water or stock. Some people prefer it this way, but this will yield fewer servings. (See the body of this post for types of jajangmyeon.)


  3. To achieve a thinner/more liquid consistency, add an extra 1/2 cup of stock or water with a little more starch when you make starch slurry (about 1 teaspoon more).
