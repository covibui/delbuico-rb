  - step: >-
      Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bring a large saucepan of salted water
      to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until slightly al dente, about 10 (i
      say 7 minutes) minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.




      Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until frothy.




      Add the Velveeta, butter (I add it to the hot macaroni and let it melt) and 2 cups of the half-and-half to the large bowl of eggs. Add the warm macaroni tossing until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth. (Scald half the half and half.  Beat the other half with the eggs and slowly add the hot mixture to the egg mixture).  (Turn on heat under the pot of macaroni at the very lowest setting) Add the remaining half-and-half, 3 cups of the sharp yellow Cheddar, the remaining grated cheeses, and salt and pepper, tossing until completely combined in the large bowl. (I also add garlic powder and onion powder and I add more salt).




      Pour the mixture into 9 by 13-inch casserole or baking dishes (approximately 3 (3-quart) baking dishes) and bake for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of sharp yellow cheese and bake until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes more.  (Be careful not to overcook casserole as it becomes hard)




      Serve hot.
