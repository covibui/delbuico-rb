      Whip cream cheese and butter together with a mixer.


      Add vanilla and powdered sugar (one cup at a time) Whip together.


      Add cool whip and mix on low-medium speed until light and fluffy.



      Using a large star tip, pipe frosting on cupcakes. (I just used a ziplock bag with the tip pushed through one corner of the bag.) These cupcakes are great for Memorial Day or 4th of July. I dipped half of a strawberry in melted white chocolate and dipped the tip into blue decorating sugar and placed the berry on top of the cupcakes.

  This frosting made a great wedding dress cupcake cake. The frosting maintained its shape and texture all afternoon.
