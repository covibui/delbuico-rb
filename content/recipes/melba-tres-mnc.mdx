      1. Cook the macaroni in boiling, salted water until al dente. Drain, and shock in cold running water to stop the cooking. Set aside.


      2. Preheat the oven to 350°F.


      3. Place the cream in a medium saucepan over low heat and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Stir in half the Cheddar and half the pepper Jack along with the onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Temper the egg by adding a small amount of the hot cheese sauce and stirring gently. Continue adding small amounts of sauce until the egg is very warm but not cooked like scrambled eggs. Just before removing the sauce from the flame, stir in the egg followed by two thirds of the mozzarella. Adjust the seasonings to taste.


      4. Place the macaroni in a 9x13 baking dish, or one large enough to mix ingredients safely. Pour in the cheese sauce, then add the remaining pepper Jack and mozzarella and half the remaining Cheddar. Mix well and distribute evenly. Sprinkle the last of the Cheddar on top, cover the pan with aluminum foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Just before it's done, remove the foil to allow the top to brown.


      5. Serve hot or let it cool gradually to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Before reheating, bring back to room temperature and stir in additional shredded cheeses and cream to moisten. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven until hot.
