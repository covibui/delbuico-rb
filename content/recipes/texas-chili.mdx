  It's that time of year where chili cook-offs beg your entry, and the thought of sitting down to enjoy a delicious homemade chili sounds drool-worthy. I love a good Texas chili. No beans. Just beef and the veggies. I love cooking it in a slow cooker so it can stew all day and fill the house with that to-die-for smell. By the time I sit down with the bowl I'm absolutely ravenous. It's so hearty and soul warming for a crisp fall evening. And it's the perfect excuse to eat [cornbread](http://www.thestayathomechef.com/2013/05/easy-buttermilk-corn-bread-muffins.html) which is always going to be amazing. This is my take on Texas Chili and as I'm sitting here eating a bowl of leftovers as I write this, I must say it is pretty dang good.

      1. Heat a large non-stick skillet over high heat. Sear the beef cubes on all 4 sides, about 60 seconds per side. Remove from the pan and place directly in a slow cooker.



      2. Place the diced onion, red bell peppers, carrots, worcestershire sauce, beef broth, diced tomatoes, green chilis, tomato paste in the slow cooker. Add in the spices (chili powder, cumin, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt). 


      3. Cook on low for 10-12 hours.
