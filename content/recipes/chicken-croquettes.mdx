  - item: 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
  - item: 1 tablespoon white onion, chopped finely
  - item: 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, divided
  - item: 1 cup whole milk, room temperature
  - item: 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
  - item: 1 tablespoon dry cooking wine
  - item: 1 pound cooked chicken
    substitute: " (use leftovers or store-bought rotisserie chicken, shredded)"

directions:
  - step: >-
      
      In a large skillet or saucepan, melt butter and sautÃ© with onion on medium-low heat until translucent.
  - step: >-
      
      Slowly whisk in the milk, 1/3 cup of flour, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Constantly stir until a thick sauce forms - a roux.
  - step: >-
      
      Add the cooking wine and cooked chicken to the sauce. Mix it all together slowly. Let it simmer for 5 minutes on low heat. Transfer to a bowl.
  - step: >-
      
      Let the filling rest at room temperature then refrigerate for 2 hours. The mixture has to harden in order to form into logs and coat evenly. If this step is skipped, it will be very hard to form logs, coat with breading and fry. This is an important step. Don't skip it.
  - step: >-
      
      Remove filling from refrigerator. Spoon approximately 1 tablespoon of the mixture and form a log 3" long and about 1" thick. Repeat until you have all the croquettes done.
  - step: >-
      
      In a bowl, whisk eggs and set aside. In another bowl, mix the remaining flour and bread crumbs.
  - step: >-
      
      Dip each croquette in egg and then cover in bread crumbs. Let them rest at room temperature for 5 minutes before frying.
  - step: >-
      
      In a large skillet, add enough vegetable oil to cover the croquettes completely. Make sure the oil is at 375 degrees F. Fry each one until golden brown, approximately 3-4 minutes.
  - step: >-
      
      Remove croquettes from oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plates. Serve and enjoy!
