      Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.


       

      Prep your ingredients: Dice the butter and Velveeta and set aside.



      In the large saucepan add the macaroni and cook until al dente, about 7-10 minutes.

      Prep your ingredients: Divide milk in 2 sections (1 1/2 cups each) Add the 5 eggs to one part of the milk. Mix very well, until no egg white are showing. Grate and dice the cheese separate and divide in three sections



      Drain the macaroni but save a 1/2 to 1 cup of the pasta water. Melt the butter and the Velveeta cubes in the hot pasta. The heat on the pot of pasta should be very very low or just off at this point.

      Add/scald the milk (1 1/2 cups) into the pot. Season liberally with pepper garlic and onion powder. I tend to reduce the salt I add because of the cheese. And nutmeg. Taste and adjust the seasonings until satisfied.



      Turn on the heat on low if not already and very slowly add the milk and egg mixture while stirring the pasta. The goal is to temper the eggs into the warm mixture so the eggs do not cook. When fully incorporated keep stirring occasionally to keep the eggs from cooking at the bottom of the pot. Add 1/3 of the grated cheese to the pot and stir. Warm the cheese until it's starting to melt. It is ok if the cheese is not fully melted, the most important thing is to not cook the eggs in the mixture.



      Pour 1/2 of the pasta mixture in the pan. Sprinkle another 1/3 of the grated cheese in the baking dish. Add the rest of the pasta then sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. At this point you can put in the fridge and save for the day you will bake.



      When baking cook 30 min covered with foil. Bake for 10-20 min uncovered until the pasta is set but not a solid. For a crispy cheese crust, broil the mac and cheese until you get the desired look, but WATCH it in the oven, it will only take 2-5 min.
