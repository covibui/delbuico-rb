ingredients:
  - item: 2 racks spare ribs
  - item: 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
  - item: 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

  - item: 2 teaspoons hickory smoked salt

directions:

      Pat the ribs dry with paper towels. If the membrane hasn't been removed from the back part of the ribs, peel it off with a sharp knife. (It will come off easily.) Combine the sugar and all the spices to make a rub. Massage it generously all over the ribs. Give yourself 24 hours for the rub to do its work.
  - step: >-

      Place the ribs on a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil and cover with a second sheet of foil. Roll up the edges of the bottom sheet all around to cover the edges of the top sheet and make sure that none of the juices can escape. Refrigerate the ribs in their foil for 24 hours.
  - step: >-

      Take the ribs out of the refrigerator and, still wrapped in the foil, let them comet room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes.
  - step: >-

      Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300°F.5. Place the ribs, still in the foil, in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees and bake the ribs for 3½ hours until the meat is tender. Open the foil packages to line the rimmed baking sheet and brush the ribs with BBQ sauce. Turn up the oven temperature to 350°F. Return the ribs to the oven and cook uncovered for 30 minutes more. Remove from the oven and cut them apart between the bones before serving.
