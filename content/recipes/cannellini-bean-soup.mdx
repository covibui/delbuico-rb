  The taste of the spicy Ital­ian sausage really comes through in this homey, hearty soup, as do each of the other indi­vid­ual fla­vors and tex­tures. Unlike so many bean soups, this soup is not a thick “por­ridge.” The broth is light and refresh­ing, with only a bit of the ten­der, tooth­some beans mashed at the end to give the soup a lus­cious body.





  NOTE   You must hydrate the beans before mak­ing the soup. You can choose the 8–24 hour method or 2-hour method.
ingredients:
  - item: 1 pound dried can­nellini beans, rinsed (2½ cups) (makes 4 cups cooked
      beans)
  - item: 2 table­spoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - item: " 1 pound premium-quality Ital­ian sausage, loose or cas­ing removed"
    substitute: (mild or hot; I used 4 Isernio’s Hot Ital­ian Sausages)
  - item: 3 cups chopped yel­low onion (1 large onion)
  - item: 6 cloves gar­lic, peeled, and minced or pressed
  - item: 2 bay leaves
  - item: 1 tea­spoon dried thyme
  - item: "8–10 cups chicken or veg­etable stock "
  - item: 10–12 fin­ger­ling pota­toes or baby new pota­toes, cut into ½-inch dice
      (4 cups)
  - item: " 2–3 car­rots, peeled, and chopped or sliced (1 cup chopped)"
  - item: 2–3 cel­ery stalks, trimmed, and chopped or sliced (1 cup chopped)
  - item: 2 Ana­heim chiles, stemmed, ribbed, seeded, and chopped (1 cup chopped)
  - item: small hand­ful broc­coli raab or Lacinato kale, coarsely chopped
  - item: 2 table­spoons fresh lemon juice
  - item: " fine sea salt, to taste"
  - item: freshly ground black pep­per, to taste
  - item: ¼ cup chopped parsley

      1. Slow Hydra­tion: At least 8 hours before you plan to make the soup, put the can­nellini beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Hydrate for 8–24 hours. Drain the beans and dis­card the water.

      2. Fast Hydra­tion: Alter­na­tively, in a soup pot, cover beans with water, bring to a boil, and boil for two min­utes. Remove from the heat, cover, and let hydrate for 2 hours. Drain the beans and dis­card the water.

      3. To cook the sausage, in a large soup pot, over brisk heat, heat the olive oil, and then pinch marble-sized pieces of sausage into the pot. Stir often with a wooden spoon to brown the meat evenly. If there is more than ¼ cup of fat and oil in the pan after brown­ing the sausage, drain off the excess.

      4. When the sausage is well browned, reduce the heat to medium-low, and add the onions and gar­lic. Sauté slowly until the onions are ten­der and translu­cent, scrap­ing up the brown bits on the bot­tom of the pan with a wooden spoon.

      5. Add the bay leaves, thyme, and chicken stock, and stir to combine.

      6. Add the beans and bring to a slow sim­mer. Par­tially cover the soup pot and sim­mer slowly for 1½ to 2 hours, until the beans are almost ten­der. Remove ½ cup of the beans and reserve.

      7. Add the pota­toes, car­rots, cel­ery, and chiles. Sim­mer just until tender.

      8. Mash the reserved ½ cup of beans and add back to the soup. This will thicken the broth slightly.

      9. Just before serv­ing, stir in the broc­coli raab or kale, and sim­mer for 2 minutes.

      10. Add lemon juice, and salt and pep­per to taste.

      11. Ladle into bowls, and gar­nish each serv­ing with parsley.
