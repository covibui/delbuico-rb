      1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.


      2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking soda and mix well.


      3. In a second bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together on high for 5 minutes, stopping once or twice to scrape down the bowl.


      4. Still beating, add the yolks to the butter and sugar mixture one at a time.Continue beating while you gradually add the sour cream. Next, beat in the vanilla extract. Finally, beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl again to incorporate all of the ingredients.


      5. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until fluffy, then fold them into the batter.


      6. Grease a 10-inch Bundt pan with the butter remaining on the insides of the butter wrappers you saved. Spoon the batter evenly into the pan and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes, until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.


      7. Cool the cake in the pan, then hit the side of the pan a couple of times with a fork (or knock it against the counter) and shimmy it from side to side before covering it with a plate and turning the cake out.
