  I’m in a bit of a veg-obsessed state at the moment. My absolute favorites right now are beetroot and cauliflower and I have a feeling my family are going to beg me to stop serving them these two vegetables in every way, shape and form pretty soon as they are appearing on our dinner table almost every day.


  The weather has been quite icy here over the last two weeks and so a comforting soup was just what was needed a few nights ago. I had two beautiful heads of cauliflower waiting to be used and I decided to do a soup inspired by one I did in my book. The one in my book is a simple cauliflower base topped with crispy bacon but I wanted to amp up the flavour and decided to roast the cauliflower before adding it to the soup. This created intense depth of flavour (and FIY, roasted cauliflower is incredible, just on its own). Instead of pureeing the soup completely, I decided to keep half chunky to add texture and then decided to stir in a little truffle oil to add that delicious earthy flavour.


  I served the soup with chunky bacon lardons for added deliciousness and chunky ciabatta bread sticks for dipping into the soup.
