      **Preparation**


      1. Clean the chicken breasts using the juice of one lemon and rinse thoroughly with water. Rinse thoroughly with water


      2. In a large enough pot, add the chicken, onion, cilantro, green onion, celery, leek, ají dulce Venezolano, and salt. You don’t have to worry about chopping these ingredients, they are being used to add flavor to the chicken. Use enough water to cover all the ingredients and cook everything at medium heat for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken is done.


      3. Remove the chicken from the pot, drain and set it aside to cool down. Set aside to cool down


      4. Wash and peel the potatoes. Cook the potatoes with enough water and a little bit of salt.  Boil for about 10 minutes.  You want them to be done, but still firm so they don’t get mushy while making the salad.
